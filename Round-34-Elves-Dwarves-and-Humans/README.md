There are three JSON files, dwarves.json, elves.json and humans.json. The <select> dropdown allows the user to select one of them. When the user chooses any of the three, display in the <ul> the name and age for each character in the respective JSON file.


For example, if the user selects "Elves", they should see the following:

<br>
<br>
<img src="./image.png" alt="sample" width="550"/>


Hints:


Use the change event, instead of click to detect if the user has selected a new option for the <select> element.
